# 🚗 Parking Space Occupancy Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as **Task 1** during my **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Internship at Alfido Tech**.

The objective of this project is to classify parking spaces into different occupancy categories using supervised machine learning algorithms. The model analyzes parking slot images and predicts whether a parking space is:

- 🟢 Free
- 🔴 Occupied
- 🟡 Partial

Two machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

The Random Forest model achieved the highest classification accuracy and was selected as the final model.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a supervised classification model.
- Extract parking slot images from the dataset.
- Train multiple machine learning models.
- Compare model performance.
- Evaluate using various classification metrics.
- Visualize model performance using graphs.
